# BEPS-PAMS-CLASS

Link to current version: [BEPS-PAMS-CLASS](https://intr-eeg.github.io/BEPS-PAMS-CLASS/)

BEPS-PAMS-CLASS is currently hosted on [pavlovia.org](https://pavlovia.org/), so development would be done in a separate repo. This repo contains a copy of the minimum required files to run a demo.
